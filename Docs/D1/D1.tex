\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
This is the Software Requirement Specification for Hacker Sim.

\subsection{Purpose}
\label{sub:purpose}
The purpose of the document is to lay out a description and intention of the 
software that is being developed for both the client and the developers. It 
will convey the software and hardware requirements of the game, as well as the 
design constraints of the software. Furthermore, this document is used to define 
our product, its functionality and performance which will be used to verify the 
product in the testing process. 

\subsection{Scope}
\label{sub:scope}
The purpose of the proposed software, Hacker Sim, will be an enjoyable, 
interactive game that will allow the user to grow their specimen and beat their 
highscores. The focus of the application is to grow a Software Engineer in their 
room. Both the Software Engineer and their room can be upgraded using the 
in-game currency. The in-game currency will be acquired through the completion 
of tasks. Online capabilities will give users the ability to share their rooms 
and chat as well as give gifts to other users to help complete tasks.

\section{Overall Description}
\label{sec:overall_description}

\subsection{Product Perspective}
\label{sub:product_perspective}
The product is a system modeling application for desktop computers based on the 
Unity platform using C\#. The product design itself is not a continuation of any 
predecessor products, but in the past there were many implementations with a 
similar concept; raising a digital being. The trend of virtual pet games started 
from mid 1990s to early 2000s, popularized by the Tamagotchis. Our product will 
differentiate itself by giving users an experience of raising a software 
engineer from the very beginning. Our product is a self-contained system that 
will not be interacting with other systems.
\\\\
The system’s main features:
\begin{enumerate}[1)]
    \item A server with functionalities:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item To provide users with online access via login/logout
        \item To connect a database with the implementation of a game
        \item To allow different users to share and interact with each other
        \item To allow users to give feedback and report bugs
    \end{itemize}
    \item A database or a file management system on the user’s computer for 
    storing:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item User account information set
        \item User game progress
        \item Product FAQs for convenient look-up
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Product Functions}
\label{sub:product_functions}
\subsubsection{Function Summary}
The system’s functionality is centralized around the user raising their digital 
specimen as a Software Engineer (referred to as SE below). The user will be 
involved with the lifecycle of specimen and attempt to promote it with a set 
of means and reach end-game goal. A currency system is designed for the in-game 
shop and the user can earn currency from initiating interactions/events with 
their SE. For example, working and completing coding projects. The in-game 
shop contains three main categories of items: interactable items (exercise 
equipment), furniture and room upgrades and food. The specimen has a list of 
metrics, i.e. tiredness, happiness, age, health, etc. The user must follow 
certain rules to keep metrics within a rational range, otherwise it will 
hinder specimen growth or lead to game failure. The user will be able to view 
their specimen’s information to check their progress and current health. 

\subsubsection{List of Basic Functions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item User creates a SE.
    \item Users initiate events and interact with their SE.
    \item Users purchase items from the in-game shop.
    \item Users utilize items.
    \item Users customize specimen’s room.
    \item Users view specimen’s information.
    \item Users reset their game stage and start a new one.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Function Domain}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{"Function Domain Figure".png}
    \caption{Function Domain}
\end{figure}

\subsection{User Characteristics}
\label{sub:user_characteristics}
Intended users do not have to meet a strict set of requirements to use our 
product. Users can be a PhD student or no education. They are not required to 
have past experience of similar types of games either. In general, it is 
considered that the user should:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Have a hardware to run our product on, i.e. desktop, laptop, etc.
    \item Have basic knowledge of operations for computer with access to internet
    \item Be able to read FAQs and understand how to use the product
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Constraints}
\label{sub:constraints}
Items that might limit the developer's options:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Regulatory policies: Unity has term of service that developers need 
    to follow
    \item Basic requirements expectation set by the project outline: Our 
    product must satisfy these functionalities. Features that have a conflict 
    with those won’t be our options.
    \item Project deliverable deadlines and schedule: In the given limiting 
    time, we may not be able to develop various complex functions that are not 
    included in project outlines with complex implementations.
    \item Developer team’s experience: Some people are using Unity platform for 
    the first time and have finite experience with creating and designing games.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\label{sub:assumptions_and_dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item As mentioned above in section 2.3, all requirements are based on the 
    criteria outlined for proper use of the product. If definitions change 
    during development, requirements will change accordingly.
    \item All requirements are written under the assumption that our product is 
    able to run on users’ hardware - the user’s hardware supports the technology 
    of our product.
    \item It is assumed that the product is running in an environment with 
    internet connection.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Apportioning of Requirements}
\label{sub:apportioning_of_requirements}
Requirements that may be delayed until future versions of the system:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Customization of SE’s room feature might be delayed as it is not a 
    core feature to support main functions of system and it is not a requirement 
    set by project outline
    \item Interaction between SEs of different users feature might be delayed 
    if the team cannot find a proper way to achieve this function in the given 
    time
\end{itemize}

\section{Use Case Diagram}
\label{sec:use_case_diagram}
In this section, we have three Use Case diagrams to illustrate the required 
business events and their interactions with each other and the user.

\subsubsection*{Use Case Diagram 1:}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{"Use Case Diagram 1".png}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Create SE: The user creates his SE, by customizing the basic 
    properties of the SE.
    \item Purchase Items: User purchases in-game items for his SE with in-game 
    currency.
    \item Let the SE Play Games: The user can let his SE play games to gain 
    happiness.
    \item Increase Currency: The user increases his SE’s in-game currency by 
    letting SE work on software projects which would also increase the SE’s 
    level of tiredness.
    \item Accessing Inventory and Using Items: The user accesses the SE’s 
    inventory, adds items into inventory and uses the items inside.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Use Case Diagram 2:}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{"Use Case Diagram 2".png}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Using Exercise Equipment: The user lets the SE exercise with 
    its exercise equipment. Letting the SE exercise would keep the SE fit, make 
    the SE tired, and also prolong the SE’s lifespan if the exercise equipment 
    have been used frequently.
    \item Feed The SE: The user shall be able to feed the SE by ordering food 
    in-game. Feeding the SE would decrease the SE’s hunger. 
    \item Overfeed The SE: The user overfeeds the SE by ordering food in-game 
    when the SE is not hungry. Overfeeding the SE could make the SE’s unhealthy.
    \item Improve SE’s skill: The user upgrades the SE’s programming skills, 
    by selecting the skill which the user wants to upgrade, confirming his 
    selection and spending certain amount of SE’s in-game programming experience 
    to complete upgrading. Upgrading programming skills could increase SE’s income.
    \item Communicate With Other Users: The user shall be able to communicate 
    through the system with other users. By communicating with other users, the 
    user can send/receive messages to/from other users, share pictures of the 
    SE’s room and the SE’s current programming skills to other users.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Use Case Diagram 3:}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{"Use Case Diagram 3".png}
\end{figure}

Use-case diagram 3 (references Business Event 5) outlines the interactions 
between the user and the systems reaction to a discrete amount of time passed. 
When a discrete amount of time has passed the system will notify the user of an 
event that may have occurred. These events include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The SE’s current state (tired, hungry, etc.)
    \item Relevant metrics for the SE
    \item The completion of a current project, and the awarded currency
\end{itemize}
